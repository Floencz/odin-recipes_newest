    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      To me, lasagna is one of the most comforting dishes imaginable, but the
      reality is I only make it once a year at best. This labor-intensive
      Italian dish requires hours of preparation in the kitchen, which I rarely
      have. Enter skillet lasagna, the perfect dish to satisfy all your lasagna
      cravings with half the effort and time.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef, preferably 85/15</li>
      <li>3 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt-free Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon fine salt, more to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more to taste</li>
      <li>One 24-ounce jar marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>8 ounces uncooked lasagna noodles, broken</li>
      <li>1 cup ricotta</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, more for serving</li>
      <li>2 cups (8 ounces) shredded low-moisture mozzarella</li>
      <li>Fresh basil, thinly sliced, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to coock</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat <strong>1 tablespoon</strong> olive oil on medium-high in a large,
        oven-safe, straight-sided skillet with a lid. Once the oil begins to
        shimmer, add 1 pound ground beef, and cook, breaking up the beef with a
        wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the pan to the broiler and broil until the cheese melts and is
        golden brown and bubbly, 1 1/2 to 3 minutes, depending on the strength
        of your broiler.
      </li>
    </ol>
